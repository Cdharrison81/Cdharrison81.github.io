    <a href="Files/Sketches.pdf"><img src="Images/Sketches.png"></a>
    <p>
    These are sketches of potential apps that could possibly work as reminder based time-managment apps, The first one is my most
    developed one and that is primarly because that sketch is the more thought out while the others come directly from potential ideas,
    found in the affinity diagram.
